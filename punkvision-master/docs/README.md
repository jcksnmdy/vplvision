# punkvision

## What is punkvision?

A vision solution that is extremely fast, and very suited to FRC usage.

### What can it do?

punkvision can handle multiple cameras each streaming at 20+ fps realtime, and searching for vision targets, all on a raspberry pi.

### Who is it for?

Beginning teams who want to use an external vision processor or fully utilize their roboRIO more efficiently than GRIP.

## How can I use it?

Well, just follow the [quick start guide](./#/quickstart), and go along!

It is mainly terminal based, but we plan to have whole raspberry pi images and prebuilt versions available.
